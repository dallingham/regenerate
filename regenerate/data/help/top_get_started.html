    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Regenerate has three levels of data, each of which has a tab on
      the left side of the screen. The lowest level is the <b>Register
      Set</b>, where individual registers are defined. The second
      level is the <b>Block</b>, where related registers set instances
      are grouped together into a logical block. The last level is
      the <b>Top Level</b> which groups blocks together into a top
      level design.</p>
    <p>Currently, there are no blocks defined. Until there are, block
      instances cannot be added to the top level. The next step is to
      either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create new blocks under the <b>Block</b> tab by clicking on
      the new block button in the lower left corner of
      the <b>Block</b> tab.</li>
      <li>Load an existing block from a <tt>.regb</tt> file by
	clicking on the add block button in the lower left corder of
	the <b>Block</b> tab. This will add the block and and register
	sets that it uses to the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once blocks have been defined, you can add instances of the blocks
      to the top level by clicking on the <b>Add</b> button to the right.
      This will display a menu of the available blocks that can be added.
      Selecting one of these will add the instance to the top level, where
      it can be configured.
