    <h3>Bit Field Properties</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>Output is static</dt>
      <dd>Indicates that the register's value is stable, and will not
      change during operation. The value will be set at initialization
      and not altered. Regenerate will mark the signal
      as <em>quasi-static</em>, and will be identified as such for
      static timing and synthesis.</dd>
      <dt>Has write side effects</dt>
      <dd>Indicates that writing this register can have side effects
      that may affect the design. When a field is marked as having
      side effects, it will be dropped from the UVM bit bash
      tests.</dd>
      <dt>Uses alternate reset</dt>
      <dd>Indicates that the bit field does not use the standard reset
      signal on its control bus to reset this signal. Instead, the
      alternate reset will be used. This allows bit fields values to
      survive a standard reset. The secondary reset must be enabled in
      the register set before this can be used.</dd>
      <dt>Is an error status field</dt>
      <dd>Indicates that this bit field represents an error field
      (active high when an error has been detected. This can be used
      to automated error detection in firmware.</dd>
      <dt>Can be safely randomized</dt>
      <dd>Indicates that this value can be safely randomized without affecting other controls. This is used for randomization in UVM testing.</dd>
      <dt>Volatile</dt>
      <dd>Indicates that the bit field can change between reads,
      typically altered by hardware. This tells the UVM register
      package to mark the field as being volatile, so that it knows
      that it cannot use mirrored value.</dd>
