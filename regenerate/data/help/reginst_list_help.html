    <h2>No Register Sets Exist</h2>
    <p>Currently, there are no register sets defined. Until there are,
      register set instances cannot be added to this block. The next
      step is to either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create new register set under the <b>Register Sets</b> tab by
      clicking on the new register set button in the lower left corner
      of the <b>Register Sets</b> tab.</li>
      <li>Load an existing register set from a <tt>.regp</tt> file by
	clicking on the add register set button in the lower left
	corner of the <b>Register Sets</b> tab.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once register sets have been defined, you can add instances of
      the register sets to the block by clicking on the <b>Add</b>
      button to the right.  This will display a menu of the available
      register sets that can be added.  Selecting one of these will
      add the instance to the block, where it can be configured.
