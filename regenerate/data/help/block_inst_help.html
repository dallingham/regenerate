    <h3>Block Instances</h3>
    <p>
      A <em>block instance</em> is an instantiation of a block at the
      top level. The <em>block</em> is the definition, and the <em>block
      instance</em> is the actual object. In software terms, you can
      think of the block as a <em>class</em> and the block instance as
      the <em>object</em>. There can be multiple instatiations of the
      same block at the top level.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a block instance is created, it needs to be described to the
      system with some additional information. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<strong>Instance name</strong>. Each instance has to have a
	unique name to distiguish if from the other instances.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Address base</strong>. Indicates where the instance is
	located in the address map relative to the other
	instances. Instance address ranges (the address base + the
	block size) may not overlap.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Repeat</strong>. Indicates if the instance is actually
	an array of instances or a single instance. If the repeat
	count is greater than 1, it is considered to be an array. Each
	instance is a contiguous block in the address map, with next
	instance immediately beginning where the last instance in the
	array ended.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>HDL Path</strong>. The HDL path maps to the
	heirarchical path to the to the block instance within the
	design. While optional, this path is used by the static timing
	and UVM register package exporters.  In the HDL path, the
	index is represented in the path with a <tt>%0d</tt> value,
	and must be the same between all instances in the array. It is
	recommended that a <tt>generate</tt> statement be used to
	create instaces of the block in the RTL code.
      </li>
    </ul>
