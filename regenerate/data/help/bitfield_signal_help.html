    <h3>Bit Field Signals</h3>
    <p>Up to four optional signals can be associated with a bit field,
      depending on the bit field type. These are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Output signal. The output signal provides the value of the
	register to the rest of the hardware design.</li>
      <li>Input signal. The input signal provides data that allows the
	hardware to alter the value of the register. The exact
	functionality depends on the bit field type. If the bit field
	type does not support an input signal, the field will not be
	editable.</li>
      <li>Control signal. The control signal typically controls when
	the input signal is allowed to alter the register bit. If the
	bit field type does not support a control signal, the field will
	not be editable.</li>
      <li>One Shot signal. If the bit field type can generate a one
	shot, it will use the same name as the output signal, with a
	"<tt>_1S</tt>" appended to the name.</li>
    </ul>
