    <h2>Documentation</h2>
    <p>
      Documentation in regenerate is written in restruturedText
      format. Each document can have multiple pages, and each page can
      be tagged with tags.
    </p>
    <h3>reStructuredText</h3>
    <p>
      reStructuredText is a text based markdown language that allows
      complex formating to be done in basic text. See the
      <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html">
	reStructuredText Quick Reference
      </a>
      for more details.
    </p>
    <h3>Pages</h3>
    <p>
      Pages appear as separate tabs. Clicking on the Add button in the
      upper right corner of the editor will add a new named page to
      the document. The selected page can be deleted by clicking on the
      Remove button.
    </p>
    <h3>Tags</h3>
    <p>
      Each page can be tagged with labels. The document editor does not
      set any policy on the tags. Multiple tags may be added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tags can be used to (among other things):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Document restrictions and confidentiality</li>
      <li>Organization</li>
      <li>Display control</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Tags appear on the bottom of the page. They are added by
      clicking on the Add Tag button in the upper corner of the
      window. Tags are removed by clicking on the close button on the
      tag itself.
