    <h3>Signals</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt><b>ADDR</b></tt></dt>
      <dd>Address bus. The address is driven by the initiator. It must
	be held stable throughout the transaction, asserted
	when <tt><b>RD</b></tt> or <tt><b>WR</b></tt> is asserted, and
	held until <tt><b>ACK</b></tt> is asserted.</dd>
      <dt><tt><b>WR</b></tt></dt>
      <dd>Write Strobe. The write strobe is driven by the initiator,
	and indicates that the transaction is a write
	transaction. Once asserted, it must be held until the target
	asserts <tt><b>ACK</b></tt>.</dd>
      <dt><tt><b>BE</b></tt></dt>
      <dd>Write Byte Enables. The byte enables are driven by the
	initiator, and indicate which byte lanes on
	the <tt><b>WDATA</b></tt> bus hold valid data to be
	written. If the bit in the <tt><b>BE</b></tt> bus is not set,
	then the corresponding byte on the <tt><b>WDATA</b></tt> bus
	is not written. The value on this bus must be stable
	throughout the transaction.</dd>
      <dt><tt><b>WDATA</b></tt></dt>
      <dd>Write Data. The write data bus is driven by the initiator,
	and contains the data to be written during a write
	operation. The value on this bus must be stable throughout the
	transaction.</dd>
      <dt><tt><b>RD</b></tt></dt>
      <dd>Read Strobe. The read strobe is driven by the initiator, and
      indicates that the transaction is a read transaction. Once
      asserted, it must be held until the target
      asserts <tt><b>ACK</b></tt>.</dd>
      <dt><tt><b>RDATA</b></tt></dt>
      <dd>Read Data. The read data bus is driven by the target. It
	contains the data associated with the requested address. It is
	valid only when <tt><b>ACK</b></tt> is asserted on a read
	transaction.</dd>
      <dt><tt><b>ACK</b></tt></dt>
      <dd>The acknowledge is driven by the initiator, and indicates
      that the cycle is complete. It is asserted only for a single
      clock per transaction. For write operations, it indicates that
      the target has accepted the write data. For read operations, it
      indicates that the data on the <tt><b>RDATA</b></tt> bus is
      valid.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Write operation</h3>
    <p>The write operation begins with the assertion
    of <tt><b>WR</b></tt>. When <tt><b>WR</b></tt> is asserted, the
    address (<tt><b>ADDR</b></tt>), byte enables (<tt><b>BE</b></tt>),
    and write data (<tt><b>WDATA</b></tt>) must be valid. All signals
    must be held stable until the target
    asserts <tt><b>ACK</b></tt>. At that point <tt><b>WR</b></tt> must
    be dasserted.</p>
    <p>The write interface transfers a single data phase per transaction</p>

    <h3>Read operation</h3>
    <p>The read operation begins with the assertion
    of <tt><b>RD</b></tt>. When <tt><b>RD</b></tt> is asserted, the
    address (<tt><b>ADDR</b></tt>) must be valid. All signals must be
    held stable until the target asserts <tt><b>ACK</b></tt>. At that
    point <tt><b>RD</b></tt> must be dasserted.</p>
