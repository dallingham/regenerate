    <h3>Register Set Instances</h3>
    <p>
      A <em>register set instance</em> is an instantiation of a
      regster with in a block. The <em>register set</em> is the
      definition, and the <em>register set instance</em> is the actual
      object. In software terms, you can think of the register set as
      a <em>class</em> and the register set instance as
      the <em>object</em>. There can be multiple instatiations of the
      same register set within the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a register set instance is created, it needs to be
      described to the system with some additional information. This
      includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	<strong>Instance name</strong>. Each instance has to have a
	unique name to distiguish if from the other instances.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Offset</strong>. Indicates where the instance is
	located in the address map relative to the other
	instances. Instance address ranges (the address base + the
	register set size) may not overlap.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Repeat</strong>. Indicates if the instance is actually
	an array of instances or a single instance. If the repeat
	count is greater than 1, it is considered to be an array. Each
	instance is a contiguous block in the address map, with next
	instance immediately beginning where the last instance in the
	array ended.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>HDL Path</strong>. The HDL path maps to the
	heirarchical path from the block instance to the register set
	instance.  This is combined with the HDL Path at the top level
	to create a full path to the register set instace.
	While optional, this path is used by the static timing
	and UVM register package exporters.  In the HDL path, the
	index is represented in the path with a <tt>%0d</tt> value,
	and must be the same between all instances in the array. It is
	recommended that a <tt>generate</tt> statement be used to
	create instaces of the block in the RTL code.
      </li>
    </ul>
