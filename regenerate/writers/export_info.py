Imports the exporters. Makes an attempt to load the site_local versions
first. This allows the end user to override the standard version without
fears that it will get overwritten on the next install.

Instead of directly importing the files with the import statement, we
loop through a list of items in the MODULES array, looking at the module
name, and the listed import times from that module. It makes it simpler
to maintain.
