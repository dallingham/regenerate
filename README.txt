Regenerate is a system for maintaining registers in a VLSI design. The
program allows you to specify the functionality of the registers. The
data is stored in an XML database. Once the registers have been
defined, regenerate can create:

* Synthesizable Verilog RTL code of the registers
* Documenation
* Tests
* Header files for C and assembly code
