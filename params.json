{"name":"Regenerate","body":"\r\nRegenerate is a system for maintaining registers in a VLSI design. The program allows you to specify the functionality of the registers. The data is stored in an XML database. Once the registers have been\r\ndefined, regenerate can create:\r\n\r\n* Synthesizable Verilog RTL code of the registers\r\n* Documenation\r\n* Tests\r\n* UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) register definitions\r\n* Header files for C and assembly code\r\n\r\nWhy is it called \"regenerate?\"\r\n\r\n* It \"generates\" registers. A common shorthand for register is \"reg\", \r\n  so \"reg generate\".\r\n* This is the third time I've written a program like this for similar\r\n  purposes. So, like the Doctor, when the program dies, it just\r\n  regenerates into a different form. This verison is Open Source, so\r\n  hopefully it will live on.","tagline":"Manages registers for ASIC and FPGA designs","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
